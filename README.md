# Hi, I'm Aparajita! 👋

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is where I showcase my work, skills, and everything I've been learning as a Full Stack Developer and AI/ML enthusiast.

## What's This About?

This is my personal portfolio website built with React. It's basically my digital resume where people can see my projects, learn about my skills, and get in touch with me. I built it to have a professional online presence and share my work with potential employers and collaborators.

## Cool Things You'll Find Here

- **Smooth Animations** - Things move and fade in nicely when you scroll
- **Works on Any Device** - Looks great whether you're on your phone, tablet, or computer
- **Typing Effect** - My job titles type themselves out on the homepage (pretty cool, right?)
- **My Projects** - All my best work organized in one place
- **Contact Form** - You can send me a message directly from the website
- **Newsletter Signup** - Want updates? You can subscribe!

## What I Built This With

Don't worry if these sound technical - here's what powers the website:

- **React** - The main framework I used to build everything
- **Bootstrap** - Helps make the website look good and work on all screen sizes
- **CSS** - For all the colors, layouts, and styling
- **Node.js** - Powers the contact form so you can email me

## Want to Run This on Your Computer?

### What You Need First

- Node.js installed on your computer (it's free - just Google "download Node.js")
- That's pretty much it!

### Getting Started

1. **Download this project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

2. **Install everything it needs**
```bash
npm install
```
(This might take a minute - it's downloading all the tools the website needs)

3. **Start it up!**
```bash
npm start
```

Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the website running!

## What's Inside?

Here's how everything is organized:

```
portfolio/
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # All the different sections of the website
│   │   ├── NavBar.js     # The menu at the top
│   │   ├── Banner.js     # The intro section with my photo
│   │   ├── Skills.js     # My skills section
│   │   ├── Projects.js   # Where I show off my projects
│   │   └── Footer.js     # The bottom of the page
│   ├── assets/           # Images and fonts
│   └── App.js            # The main file that puts everything together
```

## The Different Sections Explained

### Home Section
This is the first thing you see - it has my photo, a quick intro about me, and my job titles that type themselves out. I wanted to make a good first impression!

### Skills Section
A sliding carousel showing what I'm good at - frontend development, backend development, cloud stuff, AI/ML, and databases. I organized it this way so it's easy to scan through.

### Projects Section
The main attraction! This is where I show off three of my favorite projects:

1. **Crypto Trading Platform** - A full cryptocurrency trading app where users can buy, sell, and manage crypto. Built with React and Spring Boot.

2. **RAG Pipeline** - An AI-powered question-answering system that works completely offline. Great for privacy-focused applications.

3. **OTT Streaming Platform** - Think Netflix but built by me! Has user management, video streaming, and payment integration.

4. **Seattle City Hackathon** -

### Contact Section
A simple form where you can send me a message. It goes straight to my email so I can get back to you quickly.

## Want to Make Your Own Version?

Feel free to use this as inspiration for your own portfolio! Here's what you'd need to change:

1. Replace all my info with yours (name, photo, projects, etc.)
2. Update the colors in `App.css` if you want different styling
3. Add your own projects in `Projects.js`
4. Change the contact email to yours

## Having Issues?

If something's not working:
- Make sure Node.js is installed
- Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again
- Check that you're in the right folder when running commands
- Still stuck? Feel free to reach out!
